## The objective of this project was to predict the used cars price, given their independent features like kms driven, fuel, transmission, name, year, etc... Linear Regression algorithm has been used for predictive analysis. The following steps has been followed for the analysis.

1. See the data
2. Remove null values
3. Remove duplicates(including reset index)
4. Univariate Analysis
5. Convert Datatype
6. Find Outliers
7. Remove outliers
8. Bivariate Analysis
9. Check for correlation
10. Remove Highly correlated Data
11. One hot encoding
12. Predictive Analysis using linear regression
13. Metrics Evaluation

## As I'm learning Data Science, I'm yet to do some important steps like improving accuracy, hyperparameters, model tuning, etc..
